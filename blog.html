            Dr. Perlman’s work has had a profound impact on how networks
            self-organize and move data. Her innovations enable today’s link state routing protocols to be robust, scalable, and easy to manage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The particular protocol she designed in the 1980s (IS-IS)
            continues to flourish for routing IP today.
            She designed the spanning tree algorithm that
            transformed Ethernet from the original limited-scalability,
            single-wire CSMA/CD, into a protocol that can handle large clouds.
            Later, she improved on spanning tree-based Ethernet by designing TRILL
            (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links), which allows Ethernet to make optimal use of bandwidth. Her textbook Interconnections made a science out of the murky field of network protocols.
          </p>
          <p>
          She is also coauthor of Network Security,
          another very popular college textbook.
          Her contributions to network security include trust models for Public Key
          Infrastructure, data expiration, and distributed algorithms resilient
          despite malicious participants. She believes that
          designs should allow zero-configuration operation,
          and that where configuration is allowed,
          misconfiguration should not be possible.
