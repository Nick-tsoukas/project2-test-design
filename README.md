# Project 2 test started design

What do you think about the structor of layout ... It needs more work of course ...
Not sure about the colors or typography but THIS is a QUICK fix and change ... so is the basic layout ....

## Built With

* [animate.css] - for animations ...
* [cirlcetype] - Not being used but have used to curv text with a radius
* [materialize] - just used for the home page but It is so much easier and readable .... about 25% of the lines in a bootstrap html and really just the same thing like div class container / row / col s5
